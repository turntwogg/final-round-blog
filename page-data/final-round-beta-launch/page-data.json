This has been in the works for a while, an idea that orginated on a crowded San Francisco bus and has evolved to the application you see today. We saw a need for a comprehensive hub for esport and competitive video game information. Keeping up with the ever changing landscape of players, teams, and games, as well as getting up-to-date scores and results from tournaments was a chore. No longer. With Final Round, we bring all your favorite games, players, and teams under one roof, allowing you to currate the information you see. Select your favorite players or games and the site will automatically show you relevant news and tournaments.</p>\n<p>We were featured on PR Web (<a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/final_round_a_new_esports_media_platform_launches_beta_to_public/prweb16048702.htm\">https://www.prweb.com/releases/final<em>round</em>a<em>new</em>esports<em>media</em>platform<em>launches</em>beta<em>to</em>public/prweb16048702.htm</a>) with a great write up about the product and our journey to create it. This is not Final Round's final form, either. We will be continually rolling out new features and updates to better serve our users the esports content the want. Stay tuned!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 23, 2019","path":"/final-round-beta-launch","title":"Final Round Beta Launch"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"previous":null,"next":null}}}
